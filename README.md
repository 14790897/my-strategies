# Strategy Collection

This repository contains a collection of strategies that I have created, tested, and optimized. It includes:

- Strategies that I have personally developed.
- Strategies that I have backtested.
- Optimized parameters for specific strategies.

Each folder within the repository corresponds to an individual strategy. It contains:

- The source code for the strategy.
- The configuration file for the strategy.
- The backtesting results for the strategy.

Feel free to explore and use these strategies as a reference or starting point for your own trading systems!
